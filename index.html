          <strong>Advisor Recommendation:</strong>
          <p>I previously evaluated this candidate before the recent announcement about the new onboarding initiative. Since that update affects key role expectations, I have re-run my evaluation process to ensure alignment with current company priorities. Based on this re-assessment, I am assigning this candidate a score of 75.</p>
          <p>My evaluation of this candidate is based on four weighted criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Education (20%)</li>
            <li>Experience (30%)</li>
            <li>Skills (30%)</li>
            <li>Certifications and Volunteer Experience (20%)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Taylor performed strongest in Experience and Skills. These weights were determined based on the job posting‚Äôs emphasis on communication, problem-solving, and familiarity with productivity tools.</p>
          <p>Taylor has internship and assistant-level experience that closely aligns with operational coordination. His certifications in project management and Excel further reinforce his technical foundation. While he has limited full-time experience, his consistent academic performance and strong documentation skills suggest a good fit for the Junior Operations Associate role.</p>
